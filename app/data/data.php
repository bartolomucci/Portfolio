    in order to be able to participate in various international competitions on Counter Strike: Global Offensive. <br>
    These years of experience have allowed me to improve my level of English as well as strengthen my
    team spirit. <br>
    In this field, knowing how to be autonomous, having a good capacity for adaptation as well as a
    good communication is paramount just as it is in Web Development.
    From now on my free time allows me to broaden my knowledge in computer sciences. <br>
    After graduation I would like to pursue a Full Stack Developer Bachelor (BAC+3)',
